Amazon ML Challenge: Feature Extraction from Images
Overview
This project is designed to extract key features from images of boxes. The extracted features include weight, volume, voltage, wattage, and dimensions. This capability is crucial in various fields like e-commerce, where accurate product information is essential for digital stores.

Project Structure
feature_extraction.ipynb: Main script for feature extraction.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies required for the project.
README.md: This file.
images/: Directory containing sample images for testing.
Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x: Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.
Tesseract OCR: Required for text extraction from images. Download and install it from Tesseract OCR. Ensure it is correctly configured in your system's PATH.
Python Libraries: Install required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file.
Installation
Clone the Repository

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amazon-ml-challenge.git
cd amazon-ml-challenge
Set Up the Environment

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

sh
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare Your Images

Place your images in the images/ directory. Ensure that the images are clear and the text is legible for optimal OCR results.

Run the Feature Extraction Script

Execute the script to process images and extract features:

sh
Copy code
python feature_extraction.py
The script will process all images in the images/ directory, extract text and features, and print the results to the console.

Code Explanation
feature_extraction.py
This script performs the following steps:

Import Required Libraries

python
Copy code
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image
import re
import os
Define Functions

extract_text_from_image(image_path): Extracts text from an image using Tesseract OCR.
extract_information(text): Extracts weight, volume, voltage, wattage, and dimensions from the extracted text using regular expressions.
process_image(image_path): Combines text extraction and feature extraction for a single image.
process_images_in_directory(directory): Processes all images in the specified directory.
Main Execution

The script processes images in the images/ directory and prints extracted information.

Example Output
When running the script, you should see output similar to the following:

yaml
Copy code
Processing file: images/ex1.jpg
Extracted Text from images/ex1.jpg:
Weight: 2 kg
Volume: 10 L
Voltage: 220 V
Wattage: 150 W
Dimensions: 30 x 20 x 15

Information for images/ex1.jpg:
Weight: 2 kg
Volume: 10 L
Voltage: 220 V
Wattage: 150 W
Dimensions: 30 x 20 x 15
Troubleshooting
OCR Errors: If text extraction is inaccurate, ensure that Tesseract OCR is correctly installed and configured. Check image quality and clarity.
Dependency Issues: Verify that all dependencies are correctly installed. Reinstall packages if necessary.
